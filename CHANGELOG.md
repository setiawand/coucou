# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Claude Code sessions started from any terminal (Terminal, iTerm, Ghostty…) now show up in the island and can be approved from the notch. Before, only sessions started from the VS Code or Cursor terminal were picked up.

## 0.1.3 — October 3, 2026

- Answer Claude's questions from the notch: when Claude Code asks a multiple-choice question, pick an option or type your own answer right in the island, and Reply in terminal hands it back. Update your hooks in Settings to turn it on (#165) — thanks @Vega8991 for the idea (#94)
- Claude plan usage (GitHub build): turn on Settings → Agents → Plan usage to see your 5-hour and weekly limits in a small pill in the notch header, and click it for the details and reset times. Pro and Max plans; your current status line keeps working (#159)
- Chat with local models through Ollama or LM Studio, no API key needed: connect them in Settings → Chat → Local models. Answers stream in, and thinking blocks stay hidden (#156)
- Markdown in chat answers: bold, lists, headings, quotes, and code blocks with a copy button. Links open only when they are web links (#156)
- Apple Music (GitHub build): see what is playing in the notch, play, pause and skip on hover, and Mochi dances along (#144, #153)
- Settings are now organized in a sidebar (#153)
- The chat greets you by your own first name (#154)

## 0.1.2 — October 2, 2026

- Codex support (GitHub build): sessions show up live on the Codex pill, and permission requests get Allow and Deny in the notch. Install from Settings → Codex Hooks, then trust the hooks once with /hooks in Codex (#130) — thanks @lacatu5
- Cursor: Claude Code started in Cursor's terminal shows up on the Cursor pill, and you can answer its permission requests from the notch (#120).
- Pick your main coding tool in Settings → Active pills: VS Code, Cursor, Codex or Antigravity (Codex and Antigravity: GitHub build). It stays on and no longer takes one of the 4 slots (#120).
- The permission card stays in the notch until you answer it: the mouse no longer folds it, and reopening the island shows the request again (#117).
- The permission card also shows when the island is already open, and the pill you were on comes back once you answer (#120).

## 0.1.1 — October 2, 2026

- Declare the tools you use in Settings: Gemini CLI, Antigravity, Anthropic, Google AI and OpenAI pills join the existing ones (Cursor and Codex pills are coming soon), and you pick the main pill.
- Chat now supports Google AI (Gemini) and OpenAI in addition to Anthropic; switch provider and model by clicking the model name in the chat view, on macOS.
- Linux version: the Tauri app now builds for Linux too (AppImage, .deb, .rpm), with the island as a layer-shell overlay on Wayland and Claude Code hooks over a private Unix socket (#21) — thanks @Davy133
- Compact island on screens without a notch (#22) — thanks @Kamasoutra
- Only web links (http/https) open from the notch; other kinds of links from Claude or integrations are ignored (#16) — thanks @Cris1670
- Hook socket limited to your own user account, with size and time limits; logs no longer keep commands, n8n data or full URLs, and stay under 1 MB (#16) — thanks @Cris1670 and @Vignesh-Thangamariappan
- The island always reopens after folding, and Settings opens below it, resizable — thanks @rouderz
- Choose the Claude model for the chat in Settings; the list comes from your Anthropic account, and Claude Sonnet 4.6 stays the default — thanks @rouderz
- Windows build artifacts are now downloadable from a manual CI run — thanks @MysJofR
- Any agent can talk to Mochi: tag a hook payload with `coucou_agent` (e.g. `nb-hook --agent my-agent`) and it gets its own pill in the island (#7, #9) — thanks @lacatu5
- Gemini CLI and Antigravity (agy) hook support on macOS: install from Settings and their sessions show up in the island — thanks @corefusiion
